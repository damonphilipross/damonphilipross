Easier is a long term rental solution aimed at making renting a house as easy as booking a hotel room. My role was building out the backend, API endpoints, the static landing page, and frontend components using Angular, Nest JS, and PostgREST.


## Achievements

* Rapidly building components and endpoints with Angular, Nest and PostgREST resulting in a live MVP in under 3 weeks.
* Building maintainable code and a complete static frontend in line with the design spec. 
* Developed a prototype to make renting easier
