I built CareerCast to provide greater transparency over career pathways. 


## Achievements

* Solo prototyping, designing and launching the MVP using Dokku, Postgresql, Rails, Trademe API and CSS grid. 
* Creating a test suite to automate testing and take testing time from 10 minutes to 5 seconds. Reduced errors and bugs in production.
