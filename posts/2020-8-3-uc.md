Consulted on a research project to scrape pharmaceutical drug labels to see if pharmaceuticals were being tested enough during their Phase 3 trials and created a risk algorithm from warning data on the drug labels.

## Achievements

* Conducted research to build a data pipeline for automated drug label scraping, cleaning and analysis.
* Developed functions using NLP (spaCy) and other ML techniques that made usable clean data from unstructured text and PDFs increasing the parsable dataset by 600% (from 100 labels to 600 labels). 
* Created a pipeline to parse unstructured information, check its usability, clean it for analysis, and perform statistics on it. This reduced labor on data gathering and analysis per label from 1 hour to less than 1 minute.
