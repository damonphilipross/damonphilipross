For a Law Firm in Christchurch  I implemented an internal Web-App tool to make their legal processes more efficient.

### Achievements

* Prototyping, designing, and building a Web-app from user requirements.
* Reducing time spent writing documents from 3 hours to 30 minutes using the Web-app through iterations from user feedback and redesigns. 
* Giving training to employeeâ€™s of the Law firm to use and the web-app so they have greater autonomy. 
* Providing ongoing maintenance and development.
