WagieDAO was a passive income NFT built on the oasis network. I designed and developed the entire project using Next.js, web3.js and ethers.js, OpenZeppelin, Tailwind CSS, and Solidity. The core premise was to invest money from the mint into a series of pools and reallocate all money from selling back into the pools to reward holders.


## Achievements

* Designed, developed and deployed MVP of WagieDAO website and app.
* Created a NFT marketplace
* Created TG community of 1,200 interested members.
