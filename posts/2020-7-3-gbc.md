GBC is a contracting company specializing in building and concreting.  My role was to research and prototype a safety device to detect people in the swing zone of a digger.

## Achievements

* Conducted market research for a prototype device that could be built for under $400 and accurately detect humans within a distance of 7m, highlighting $10 million+ market opportunity within close existing networks. 
* Performed a benchmarking analysis on current technologies that detect people including Computer Vision, IR sensors, and thermal cameras.
* Built a prototype using cheap available parts, decreasing the build cost by 12.5% per unit by using PIR sensors OpenCV, and a Raspberry Pi.
